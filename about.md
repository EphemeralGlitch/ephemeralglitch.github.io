The author of this blog considers themselves to be a *Conscious Traveller*, an
observer experiencing a small piece of the deterministic universe.

Mono no aware (物の哀れ) which is often symbolized with the brief blooming of
cherry blossoms (さくら) describes everything the author has experienced and
expects from the rest of their life.

> Mono no aware (物の哀れ), literally "the pathos of things", and also translated as "an empathy toward things", or "a sensitivity to ephemera", is a Japanese term for the awareness of impermanence (無常 mujō), or transience of things, and both a transient gentle sadness (or wistfulness) at their passing as well as a longer, deeper gentle sadness about this state being the reality of life.
