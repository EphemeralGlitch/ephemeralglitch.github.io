Ice cream is always welcome. The treat is oh so very cool and refreshing. The best kind is not over powered with sweetness. The best kind is eaten in the summer and has bits of strawberry fruit in it.

# Pembroke Welsh Corgi

One trend that I am more than happy to get behind is the recognition for our every-friendly puppy companions. I have never had the priviledge of owning a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, but I would love to own one as my first dog.

# Futurism

I love creativity! Creativity is one of my top three favorite human traits. These days, I find my daily dose of creativity in futurism of all types: retro-futurism, solar-punk, hard sci-fi, etc. The farther out in strange-land the vehicles of creativity can take me, the better :).

# Marvin

Finally, we reach Marvin -- the real reason for this post.

> Marvin, the Paranoid Android, is a fictional character in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series by Douglas Adams.

Marvin is cool because he was a character in *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*. In addition, he seemed pretty clever and very loyal to his employer. The main reason I like Marvin is because I have decided that all of his negative thinking has made him my spirit animal ðŸ¤–.
