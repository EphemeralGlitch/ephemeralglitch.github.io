# Emergence

There is an ancient thought experiment called the [Paradox of the Heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox). The question is, how many
*grains of sand* are necessary to create a *heap of sand*? Is the answer one grain?
Two grains? More?

The thought experiment is tightly linked to the concept of [Emergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) and [Holism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism). One answer may be that, with each additional grain of sand, qualities of "heapiness" emerge and become more well defined.

# Emergent Consciousness

Have you ever wondered how many neurons are needed in order to create a brain?
The human brain contains approximately 100,000,000,000 neurons! Yet, with much
fewer neurons, brain-like qualities begin to emerge.

Consciousness is likely an emergent phenomenon, which implies degrees of consciousness. A rock
is not as conscious as an ant. An ant is not as conscious as a bat. A bat is not as conscious as a dog. Ad nauseam.

Neuroethology shows us that more neurons tend to create stronger expressions of qualities associated with consciousness.

# The Observer's Awareness

A descriptive word for *emergent consciousness* is *observer*. The *observer* is interesting because the *observer* gains more perspective and awareness as the collective grows (e.g. more neurons are added to the brain).

What would a symbolic representation of the *observer* look like? Perhaps, there is no better symbol than [The Eye of Providence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Providence).

The Eye of Providence represents the perspective of the observer, the awareness that emerges from the collective. No wonder this sacred symbol is used in organizations and groups that are interested in perspective and awareness!

Awareness oriented organizations such as the [Freemasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry), [DARPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Awareness_Office), and [A.L.I.C.E](http://alice.pandorabots.com/) are only a few of the many that embrace this symbolism.

# Real World Clarity

With the understanding of *The Observer's Awareness*, we can see the pattern everywhere.

- **Meditation:** The goal is to embrace the observer in order to gain a holistic connection, perspective, and understanding.
- **Ethereum:** The trend for decentralized currency, contracts, and organizations becomes very simple to understand. The decentralization is just a byproduct of globalization, the emergent creature that will eventually, maybe after decades or centuries, replace nation states.
- **Universe:** The nature of a god or fate would become much more clear. Humans would be a piece of an all knowing being; the all knowing being would embody all information and knowledge.

The Observer's Awareness can slowly begin to bring a harmonious understanding to every aspect of life.
